Okay, so I worked to gather and record everything that I set out to gather and record from last time, and then organized it all so it was about in order. At that point it was taking over 6 minutes to play, but I wasn't too worried because I knew I was going to need to condense it anyway. Many different parts of it were just too long, like you don't need to hear the subject run for an entire 30 to 45 seconds, that could be cut down and fade out really easily. I edited the files so there wasn't extraneous noise in the ones I recorded, cut out the sections I wanted of the ones I didn't record (which I credited int he assets file which is now called credits), and pieced them all together with a little bit of sound editing. I may need to put some more panning in, now that I think about it. I had Colin give me permission to use his voice in the ending credits, too. I did some effects editing on my own voice to make it my conscience's voice. Once I had done all that, it was at about 4 minutes, which is nice, because I believe we decided it was not a big deal to go over 4 minutes by just a little. If, however, I need to, I can condense it down a bit more. I also could maybe layer a few more files and work on transitions a bit.
